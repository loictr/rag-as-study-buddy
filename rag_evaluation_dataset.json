        "context_reference": ["Section: Windriders\nSub-section: Wind Manipulation Mechanics\nTheir wind control stems from specialized organs called aeroceptors, located beneath their wing membranes. Each Windrider possesses exactly 1,247 aeroceptors per wing, capable of detecting air pressure changes as minute as 0.001 pascals. Through precise muscular contractions, they can generate localized pressure differentials of up to 15 kilopascals, effectively creating their own thermal updrafts."],
